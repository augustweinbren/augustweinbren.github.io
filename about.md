I work as a scientific software engineer at the UK Met Office, currently developing C++ based infrastructure for observation processing and data assimilation.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins in 2019, where I studied Environmental Engineering and Applied Math and researched a novel method of thinning carbon dioxide satellite datasets using spatial statistics.

I am interested in building software that makes cities more sustainable, especially through climate change resilience and air pollution reduction.
